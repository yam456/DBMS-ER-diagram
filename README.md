# Entity Relationship Diagram
An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system.

Also known as ERDs or ER Models, they use a defined set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of entities, relationships and their attributes.

# Problem Statement 1
Suppose you are given the following requirements for a simple database for the National Hockey League (NHL):

a) the NHL has many teams,

b) each team has a name, a city, a coach, a captain, and a set of players,

c) each player belongs to only one team,

d) each player has a name, a position (such as left wing or goalie), a skill level, and a set of injury records,

e) a team captain is also a player,

f) a game is played between two teams (referred to as host_team and guest_team) and has a date (such as May 11th, 1999) and a score (such as 4 to 2).

Construct a clean and concise ER diagram for the NHL database using the Chen notation as in your textbook. List your assumptions and clearly indicate the cardinality mappings as well as any role indicators in your ER diagram.

# Problem Statement 2

Construct an E-R diagram for a car-insurance company whose customers own one or more cars each. Each car has associated with it zero to any number of recorded accidents

# Problem Statement 3

Construct an E-R diagram for a hospital with a set of patients and a set of medical doctors. Associate with each patient a log of the various tests and examinations conducted.

# Problem Statement 4

A university registrar’s office maintains data about the following entities: 

(a) courses, including number, title, credits, syllabus, and prerequisites;

(b) course offerings, including course number, year, semester, section number, instructor(s), timings, and classroom;

(c) students, including student-id, name, and program;

(d) instructors, including identification number, name, department, and title.

Further, the enrollment of students in courses and grades awarded to students in each course they are enrolled for must be appropriately modeled. Construct an E-R diagram forthe registrar’s office. Document all assumptions that you make about the mapping constraints.
